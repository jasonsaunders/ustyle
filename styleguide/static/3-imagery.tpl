            <p>Our brand imagery is made up of <strong>lifestyle photography, product and object images, illustrations,</strong>  and <strong>infographics.</strong>  All of our imagery types should reassert our brand values of fairness, clarity and confidence.</p>
            <p>It’s important to remember that imagery is an extension of the uSwitch brand. It's use is to support or convey a message, not drive it.</p>

        <div class="us-grid-row">
          <div class="us-col-md-8">
            <p>Lifestyle photography should have a British feel where possible, avoiding obviously American or global images. It should be ‘reportage’ in style, avoiding cheesy, posed, forced or unrealistic photography.</p>

        <h2>Product and object images</h2>
        <div class="us-grid-row">
          <div class="us-col-md-8">
            <p>Our product and object focused imagery may be cut out over our brand colours, brand gradients or white. When objects aren’t cut out, they should be realistic in their setting and not appear staged. Images should be straightforward, not overly metaphor based, and should not appear noticeably manipulatd. Images should be ‘documentary’ in style, avoiding cheesy, posed, forced or unrealistic photography. 
              <p>This will also extend into 3D renderings of objects, which are used within the banner areas of our website.</p>

            <div class="us-col-md-8">
              <p>Our illustration style should be straightforward, clean and simple. Illustrations should be put over our brand colours, gradients or white, and they should be 2-D where possible, and not be overly metaphor based or cliché.</p>

            <div class="us-col-md-8">
              <p>We use a 3D text effect to give some depth to our infographics. This should be used on objects to highlight or pull them out of the infographic. Due to the uniqueness of each infographic, there is not a rigid style in place. Just be as sympathetic to our guidelines as possible and use the colour palette.</p>
              <h4>Sizing</h4>
              <p>Infographics are generally displayed on our news and guide pages, so size the graphic accordingly (ie. 8 column width). They are also sometimes printed, so prepare them at 300dpi, then save at 72dpi if also needed for web.</p>
