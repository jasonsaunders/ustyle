## Tone of voice

*Please consider these general principles when writing copy.* 

- **Expert** - We have a deep understanding of people, household finances and the industries in which we operate. Be confident and authoritative.
- **Human** - We always talk on the same level as our customers. Be friendly and conversational, never patronising.
- **Connected** - We are seamlessly synchronised with the wider world and financial one. Be timely, knowledgeable and accurate.
- **Frank** - We speak truthfully and with insight. Be honest and transparent.
- **Advisory** - We make a positive impact on the lives of our customers. Be empowering and informative.

## Grammar and punctuation

*The rules of the game. Consistent grammar and punctuation make good copy easier to read and understand.* 

**Abbreviations**

For names of companies or organisations, if an abbreviation is more familiar than the full form (e.g. BBC, IBM) use that. If not, write the name in full the first time you mention it, followed by the abbreviation in brackets. The next time you refer to it, use only the abbreviation.

**Apostrophes**

Avoid common misuse of apostrophes:

- Mixing up it’s (it is) and its (possessive)
- Using to denote plural: DVD’s (wrong) vs DVDs (correct)
- When writing Dos and Don’ts (not Do’s and Don’ts)
- When writing decades 1990s (not 1990’s); the ’80s (not the 80’s)

**British English**

Use the British ‘s’ in words such as ‘realise’, and ‘specialise’, rather than the American ‘z’.

**Capital letters**

Never use all capital letters. Headlines follow usual sentence structure, with only the first word and proper nouns utilising capitals.

**Company names and references**

Follow punctuation and capitalisation of company names and products as they are branded.
> Example: E.ON, iPhone, iSaver

When referencing a company in a news or guide, remember to always keep them in the singular.
> Example: BT is launching a new ... (not BT are launching a new ...)

**Contractions**

Our tone of voice is friendly and familiar, so it’s fine to use contractions like ‘they’ll’, ‘it’ll’, ‘isn’t’.

**Dashes and hyphens**

If you use a dash within a sentence to create emphasis, then use a long em dash – rather than a hyphen.
Compound adjectives before a noun generally use a hyphen (e.g. ‘the well-organised energy provider’). After a noun, they should be separated (e.g. ‘the energy provider was well organised’).

**Exclamation marks**

Use sparingly, never in headers or intro copy, best suited for marketing/promotional material or news/blogs. 

**Full stops**

Don’t use full stops at the end of headlines.

**Legals, disclaimers and caveats**
Superscript numbering should be used when there is more than one caveat, however, when there is only one caveat in a communication, an asterisk (*) should be used.



## Microcopy

*Anything shorter than a paragraph is classified as microcopy. Think anything from tooltips to button text.* 

**Help text/tool tips** 

Tooltips are an interruption, use them sparingly (or not at all).  

Keep the tooltip text concise. Tooltips are perfect for short sentences and sentence fragments; large blocks of text can be overwhelming and should be avoided.

Tooltip text must be informative. Don't make it obvious or just repeat what is already on the screen. Because tooltip text isn't always visible, it should be supplemental info that users don't have to read.  

**Badge/label/USP**

Very short text (1-4 words max) to distinguish products from one another and highlight features of a product that are otherwise not included on the results table. Annotated versions are paired with a descriptive line.

Should be written in sentence case, not upper case. The label should be 1-4 words, while descriptive lines should be as concise as possible without wrapping on any device.

Must be quantifiable facts about a product, deal or plan - be honest and as descriptive as possible. No exclamation points.

**Product info**

Summary of product features relevant to users. Must be concise, relevant and quantifiable facts about a product, deal or plan - be honest and as descriptive as possible

Be consistent in the way and the order information is presented and the types of information shown. Second person is ok (e.g. “More people in your region switched to this plan than any other”)

**Small print**

Small print reassures users and is vital for transparency.  

As long as any compliance rules are taken into account, you should treat this copy like any other, and have a responsibility to make this text as comprehensible as possible to a user

**Caveats** 

Small print text to back up any absolute claims (i.e. savings figures), denoted with an asterisk. The caveat must appear on the same page as the asterisk

**Button text**

Very short (1-3 words) actionable description of what happens when the button clicked, namely, what's on the next page. 

Button text should “keep its promise” and properly set up expectations of what comes next

It should be concise (1-3 words), should not contain exclamation points, should feel actionable (e.g. “buy” “switch” “get” “apply” “compare”), and can make use of urgency (e.g. “today” “now”)

First person can be used (e.g. “Tell me more”).

**CTAs** 

An introduction to button text, usually one to two lines, that provides a reason to click the accompanying button

This is only used on editorial pages. Sentence case should be used, no exclamation points, and the text must relate to the button and its action

Should not be more than two lines, usually made up of a title and copy.

**Form text, form labels** 

Description of what information is required from the user. Always aim for clarity and be consistent - if using questions ('Where do you live?') or statements ('Address')

Second person is acceptable, and use tool tips to explain any terms that may be unfamiliar

Form label conventions:
- first name 
- last name
- date of birth 
- email 
- postcode 
- address 
- main account holder’s name
- driver’s name
- employment status
- annual income (before tax)

**Placeholder text for fields** 

A pre-populated in text in a field that is either an example or an instruction (“Select” or “first name”). Use sentence case and should only be used when it's a requirement. 

Symbols can be used (e.g. £ ).

**Error text**

Text that is triggered by a user trying to move forward without providing requested info.

Error text should be as specific and as useful/helpful as possible, but should also be short; sentence fragments are acceptable.

Never be alarming, technical, or condescending (in life, but especially when it comes to error text)

**H1** 

Short description of the page, at a glance. 

This text should be genuinely helpful, in sentence case, and should be kept as short as possible.

**Introductory text**

A short (two lines at most) introduction that follows on from the H1. Describes the following content and encourages the user to read on, and provides as much relevant information as possible. 

This text should be genuinely helpful, sentence case, and should tell the user whether they are in the right place.
