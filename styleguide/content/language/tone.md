name: Tone of Voice

Here at uSwitch, we offer everyone ‘Supportive Switching’.

That means we’re not just passively comparing prices, we’re actively enabling and supporting the decision to switch.

What we write, the way we speak to customers and every conversation we have must give people clear, timely and relevant information. And we should communicate that information in a simple but attractive way.

With the right tone of voice, our words create a decisive moment: we take people from passively knowing they should switch to actively having the confidence to make the right switch

## The Three core principles

**- Empathetic**  
**- Expert**  
**- Empowering**  

To give people the support they need to switch, we need to be able to deliver the right kind of message at the right time. That means our voice needs to be able to flex from simply informative – for example when we’re describing features of a product – to inspirational, when people are at the decisive moment and need extra encouragement to switch.  

The trick is to strike the right balance. Our three core principles will help us do this, guiding our communications and making sure that we deliver each message in the most appropriate way.  

Everything we say should always carry some elements of our core principles in varying degrees. The following framework is designed to make sure we get the balance right.  


<span id="Framework"></span>
## Tone framework  

Our three principles work together, and we adjust the emphasis and balance depending on who we’re talking to, why and when.  

One voice principle doesn’t exclude another; it’s how we mix them that gives uSwitch a rounded and distinctive voice.   

And, as with people, we’re not one thing all the time, or everything at once — but we have a consistent basis that’s us. For uSwitch, that means we’re always Empathetic. We dial up and down the Expert and Empowering qualities of our voice as needed.   

The key thing is to think about the main reason(s) to communicate – and use the principles accordingly.

**Human** 

We always talk on the same level as our customers. Be friendly and conversational, never patronising.

We want to make sure customers realise there are real, live people at uSwitch. So, we speak in a familiar language and in a colloquial manner, and we’re always friendly and inclusive.

**Connected** 

We are seamlessly synchronised with the wider world and financial one. Be timely, knowledgeable and accurate.

We’re experts because we listen (but not just to the industry leaders) and are involved in the industry. But we don’t just listen — we also look out for consumers, who are most impacted by any changes (or lack of).

**Advisory** 

We make a positive impact on the lives of our customers. Be empowering and informative.

We don’t just tell people what to do. We guide them into the best decision for them, and we do that by providing accurate, easy-to-understand and relevant information. We make it clear that they are in the driving seat, and we’re just here to support them when they’re unsure. 

**Frank** 

We speak truthfully and with insight. Be honest and transparent. We’re open and direct. We don’t hide relevant info or intentionally mislead our customers.
