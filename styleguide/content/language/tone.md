## Tone of voice

*Please consider these general principles when writing copy.* 

**Expert** 

We have a deep understanding of people, household finances and the industries in which we operate. 

Be confident and authoritative. We know what we’re talking about and we’re not afraid to be out in front of the news and industry happenings. 

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Do: Why the smartphone world needs a stronger Nokia OS</li>
    <li>Don't: Why we feel the smartphone world could benefit from a stronger Nokia OS</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>


**Human** 

We always talk on the same level as our customers. Be friendly and conversational, never patronising.

We want to make sure customers realise there are real, live people at uSwitch. So, we speak in a familiar language and in a colloquial manner, and we’re always friendly and inclusive. 

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Do: Having snagged voice recognition company Ivona back in January, it’s not 
too much of a leap to imagine that Amazon is prepping its own smartphone.</li>
    <li>Don't: In January, Amazon acquired Ivona, a voice-recognition company. It would 
seem the next logical step for the company is to create a smartphone using 
this technology.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

**Connected** 

We are seamlessly synchronised with the wider world and financial one. Be timely, knowledgeable and accurate.

We’re experts because we listen (but not just to the industry leaders) and are involved in the industry. But we don’t just listen — we also look out for consumers, who are most impacted by any changes (or lack of).

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Do: What Ofgem’s big announcement means for you</li>
    <li>Don't: Ofgem ‘opening up the market’ to boost energy competition</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

**Advisory** 

We make a positive impact on the lives of our customers. Be empowering and informative.

We don’t just tell people what to do. We guide them into the best decision for them, and we do that by providing accurate, easy-to-understand and relevant information. We make it clear that they are in the driving seat, and we’re just here to support them when they’re unsure. 

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Do: It’s important to apply for the right credit card for your credit rating, because when you apply for and are rejected by lots of credit cards, it harms your credit rating further. We’ve outlined which credit cards are best for you, no matter what your credit rating.</li>
    <li>Don't: Everyone can benefit from a Capital One MasterCard, with a credit limit of 
£1,500 and no annual fee.</li>
  </ul>

**Frank** 

We speak truthfully and with insight. Be honest and transparent. We’re open and direct. We don’t hide relevant info or intentionally mislead our customers.
