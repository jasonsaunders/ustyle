### Gendered language

If you're writing about a person and they have not explicitly informed of you
what pronouns they go by, use "they/them". If you're writing about imaginary
people, say, in the context of giving an example; using gender neutral pronouns
will also reach a larger audience.

Our audience includes people with many different gender identities. Instead of
saying "you guys", use "you all", "everyone" or other nondescript language.

### Ableist language

Word like "insane" and "crazy" are poor choices for general-purpose emphasis of
a statement in a world where so many face mental health issues. Words like
"shocking" and "ridiculous" are good alternatives.

<blockquote>7 Crazy Car Insurance Plans</blockquote>

Can be changed to:

<blockquote>7 Phenomenal Car Insurance Plans</blockquote>

Describing things as "stupid" or "dumb" is a bad choice of descriptor, due to
their use around people with learning difficulties. "Unwise" or "ill-advised"
are suitable replacements.

<blockquote>Company unveils stupid energy contract</blockquote>

Can be changed to:

<blockquote>Company unveils ill-advised energy contract</blockquote>

### Swearing

Swearing is a poor way of reaching people. If you feel intensely about
a topic, there are a multitude of other ways you can describe how you feel.
